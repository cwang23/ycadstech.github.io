The Yenching Data Science and Technology club was started in September 2019 by members of [Yenching Academy's](https://yenchingacademy.pku.edu.cn/) 5th cohort. Our main goals are to help develop the data analytics skills of Yenching Academy students by using tools such as R and Python. We also seek to provide students with exposure to different aspects of China's technology industry, particularly that of Beijing.


Please feel free to contact one of the club members, Clara Wang, at [cwang23@pku.edu.cn](cwang23@pku.edu.cn) if you're interested in speaking to the members of our club or partnering together.
